LinkValidator (typo3/cms-linkvalidator)
=======================================

The LinkValidator checks the links in your website for validity. It can
validate all kinds of links: internal, external and file links. The
Scheduler is supported to run LinkValidator via cron job, including the
option to send status mails, if broken links were detected.
